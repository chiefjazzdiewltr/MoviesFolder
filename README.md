# Movie Folder Organizer
This program is a organizer for movie folders, it is a personal project of mine and so there will be lots of bugs and issues.

It is a GUI application using Windows Forms, it was developed in C#. It also supports exporting and importing already existing movie lists as CSV files, with the form:
```
movie,watched_state
```
(It also removes the directory path and just leaves the name in the CSV file)


Feel free to use if you happen to need it :)
